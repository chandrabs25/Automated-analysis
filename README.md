# Automated-analysis

This tool automatically analyzes a dataset and generates a report with visualizations and a narrative summary. It uses an LLM (Large Language Model) to understand the data and provide insights.

Features:

Data Profiling: Analyzes the structure of the dataset, including data types, missing values, and summary statistics.


Automated Visualization: Dynamically selects and generates appropriate visualizations (e.g., correlation heatmaps, boxplots, histograms) based on the data.


LLM-Powered Narrative: Uses an LLM to generate a human-readable report summarizing key findings, potential issues, and insights from the data and visualizations.


Report Generation: Creates a README.md file with the analysis report and visualizations in a dedicated folder.

Python 3.11 or higher
